Users can manually enter their weight on Garmin Connect. This results in a summary with only time and weight. Users may also connect their MyFitnessPal account to their Garmin Connect account and update their weight on MyFitnessPal. This results in a summary that also just has a time and weight. Finally, a user might have a Garmin Index body composition scale and sync data from this device. This will generate a summary with all possible biometric fields.",
